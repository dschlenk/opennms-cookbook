# This property defines which RrdStrategy implementation to use for writing data to
# RRD files.  There are two RrdStrategies that ship with opennms.  The first one is
# org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.rrdtool.JniRrdStrategy.  It uses the original JNI RrdTool based code
# to write to the rrdtool compatible .rrd files.  The second version uses JRobin, a
# pure java implementation of RrdTool.  Its class name is 
# org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.jrobin.JRobinRrdStrategy
#
# To switch to the JNI implementation uncomment the following lines.  Note
# that paths may differ from one platform to the next, and a few platforms
# use an extension other than ".so" on JNI shared objects; Mac OS X notably
# uses ".jnilib":

# This property allows the definition of a custom file extension to use for data files.
# OpenNMS uses the extension to find which files to use.  The jrobin convertor tool will
# append .jrb to the filenames for the new files it creates.  This property will allow the 
# use of these new files by setting the extension to .rrd.jrb
#
# The default fileExtension is approperiate for the Strategy in use... JRobin uses .jrb and 
# JNI uses .rrd.  If you set a value here that value will be used regardless of the value preferred
# by the individual strategies.

# This property defines whether or not to use the write queuing system.  
# The write queuing queues rrd create and update operations so as not to
# lose collected data due to slow I/O performance.  As the I/O system gets
# behind this leads to multiple data points being stored per file update.
# This leads to greater amortized performance of the I/O system.

# This property defines how many threads to use to process the queue and

# This of course depends on your I/O subsystem. It is unlikely that more than 10 threads
# or so are needed here but there may be some # system where this is not true.
#
# The JRobin code however is multi-thread safe and may get some performance benefit
# by increasing threads.  This of course depends on your I/O subsystem.  It is 
# unlikely that more than 10 threads or so are needed here but there may be some
# system where this is not true.

# Setting it to true enqueues the creates and they are processed
# as the threads get to them.  False, causes the enqueuing thread to block as the
# files are created.  
#
# WARNING: There is currently a bug in the queueing of creates in that multiple creates
# will get queued if many updates happen and there is a lag in the actual creation
# due the delay of queuing.  This may cause the loss of some initial data.  It is not

# The queuing system distinguishes between zero valued and non-zero valued updates.
# Zero-value updates are termed 'insignificant' by the queuing system and pushed
# down in priority compared with 'significant' updates which have non-zero values
# if you set the "org.opennms.rrd.queuing.prioritizeSignificantUpdates" property to
# "true". The default value is "false" because this optimization is only necessary
# on systems that are heavily-loaded by data collection.
# 
# As updates are queued, files which have significant updates in their list of
# pending updates are boosted in priority to ensure that their data is written as soon
# as possible.  Files with only insignificant updates are delayed until 'free time'
# exists on the write threads and they have time to be processed.
#
# Given this situation there is an inherent 'unfairness' which on busy systems will
# cause the files with only insignificant updates to never get written.

# insignificant files will be promoted to the significant list.  This ensures that
# all files will eventually get written.
#
# An example value for this file would be 21600.  This would cause all the 
# insignificant files to be pushed through the updates queue over a six hour period.
# 
# Setting the value to 0 means don't promote insignificant files at all.

# The following property sets the default JRobin backend Factory.  Acceptable values are
# FILE, SAFE, NIO, MNIO, MEMORY.  Default is FILE.
#
# Recommended backends:
# FILE - Standard RRD algorithm, cache when possible and no locking.
# MNIO - NIO ByteBuffer RRD implementation.  Experimental.  This will become the default
#        in future OpenNMS releases.  Note that this will use more memory than FILE.  The
#        additional memory usage is nominal, but can be can be computed with:
#            additinal memory = (jrb file size) * (number of queued write threads)
#        When queuing is disabled, the number of write threads becomes the number of 
#        Collectd threads since it is these threads that with then do the persisting.
# 
# Other backends (not recommended):
# SAFE - Aggressive locking and low levels of caching.  Untested.
# MEMORY - In-memory only.
# NIO - MMAPped RRDs, using NIO.
