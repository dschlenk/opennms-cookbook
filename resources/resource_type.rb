# Define a resource type in datacollection-config.xml
# The XML makes it look like there's a relationship between resourceTypes and
# the group they exist in and maybe even the collection they are included in,
# but they don't and furthermore if you end up defining a resource type
# more than once whatever one gets seen first wins and subsequent
# definitions are ignored. In an effort to to avoid these issues, by convention
# we add groups in alphabetical order to the 'default' snmp-collection, and we
# check all files in etc/datacollection/ for an existing resourceType definition
# so if you have duplicate resource types defined in your run list, only the
# first one will end up getting converged.
